Spring has sprung, so that means it's time for the A Cappella Event of the Year!

Now celebrating their 27th birthday, Eight Beat Measure is gearing up for their second major concert of the year: Chill Beats 2015!

You'll hear your favorites from Meltdown along with plenty of brand new hits! We have a great show in store for you this year, so make sure you don't miss this one.

If you've never had the Eight Beat Experience, prepare for a life-changing night. For those of you who have seen an Eight Beat show before, you already know we do it big! 

Tickets are FREE for students and only $10 for the general public at 8Beat.org.
