The winter weather that we have been enduring this month has been tough on everybody at RIT. Our Facilities Maintenance Services plowing crew has been doing their best to clear the icy and snow covered parking lots throughout the campus, however many of our academic parking lots have lost parking spaces due to the amount of snow that had to be moved to the edges of some parking lots.

The academic lot that has been impacted the most is the general parking area in S-lot. For those of you who normally use S-lot general and cannot find an open parking space there, we are requesting that you give yourself an extra 10-minute arrival time and park in the Global Village lot that is located between CIMS and the Red Barn. If this lot is also full, it would be best to park in H-lot (North side of campus), which usually has between 200-300 open spaces.

Thanks for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. Take extra time to drive slowly to reach your destination and stay safe on the roadways. If you have questions, please email us at parking@rit.edu .or call us at (585) 475 - 2074.
